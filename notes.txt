Repository - A place where all your project files are stored, each and every one of them.


Now we all have free accounts, which means our project files are visible to everyone else.

1. Forking
Now imagine you see the source code of a website on github and you wanna make some tweaks to it, just to try it out.
Obviously, you can't change their code.
What you'll do is click on the "FORK" button. This will make a copy of the project files of the website you saw in
your github account and now you can do whatever you want without effecting the original code.

2. Clone or download
This will download a zip folder of all the project files in your computer 

3. Commit
Just open github.com, click on "new repository", give a Repository name and check the
"Initialize this repository with a README" thingy.

Create the repository.
Now, just upload a random text file in the repository.
