Repository - A place where all your project files are stored, each and every one of them.


Now we all have free accounts, which means our project files are visible to everyone else.

1. Forking
Now imagine you see the source code of a website on github and you wanna make some tweaks to it, just to try it out.
Obviously, you can't change their code.
What you'll do is click on the "FORK" button. This will make a copy of the project files of the website you saw in
your github account and now you can do whatever you want without effecting the original code.

2. Clone or download
This will download a zip folder of all the project files in your computer 

3. Commit
Just open github.com, click on "new repository", give a Repository name and check the
"Initialize this repository with a README" thingy.

Create the repository.
Now, just upload a random text file in the repository.
You'll see the option to commit changes.
This will ensure that the files are uploaded and changes are set.
Add a message, this will help you to keep track of which commit made which changes.
Like "added the sign up" "added the sign in"
You can see your commit history also by clicking on the commit counts displayed.

4. Branches
While we work on a single project in a group, we will do many changes and as we all know, adding just a
goddamn space, fucks up everything.
To prevent that we add branches.
The main branch is called the master-branch.
You can create a new branch by clicking on the left drop-down "Branch:Master"
Name it anything, like 'newtest' and click enter.

You'll see that your new branch has the exact same files as your main branch.
Now while you are in this branch any changes/commits you make to this branch will not affect the main branch,
